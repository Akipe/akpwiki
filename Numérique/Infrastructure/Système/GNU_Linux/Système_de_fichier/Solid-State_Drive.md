# Solid-State Drive

Egalement courament appelÃ© **SSD**.

## TRIM

### TRIM all SSD

Make a secure erase TRIM of SSD.

**Carefull: it will delete all files !**

```bash
blkdiscard --secure /dev/device
```

> `--secure` option : "Perform a secure discard. A secure discard is the same as a regular discard except that all copies of the discarded blocks that were possibly created by garbage collection must also be erased. This requires support from the device".

If unsupported :

```bash
blkdiscard /dev/device
```
