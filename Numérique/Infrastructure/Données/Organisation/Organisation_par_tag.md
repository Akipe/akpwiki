Tags

are semantic 'attributes' of information AND you cannot recover information in a database if you do not know the attributes of that information. Besides, two different notes ---or texts or whatever--- stored in very different folders may still share the same tags. SO many notes ENTAILS having many tags but not necessarily many folders. SOOO... you can have a vertical, hierarchical classification of folders fine-tuned semantically and 'horizontally' with tags. And to be precise on fine-tuning it, you will need hundreds of tags. BUT...
TAGS SHOULD BE SYSTEMATIZED

in a CONTROLLED VOCABULARY in a Note file of its own to avoid duplication of tagging or ambiguity or errors in tagging.

Even if that implies continuously, bit by bit, building lists of synonymical 'strings' and determining their correspondent final tags. That way you do not duplicate tags.

Because of the problem of knowing how to write those tags [ if you should write in all-capitals or tittle-case or CamelCase or no capitals at all ... ] you should decide which way you will go and stick to it --- to avoid sudo-duplicates of tags (hardDisks, HardDisks, HARDDISKS, harddisks, hard_disks, hard-disks or even hard.disks...)
I use this rule:

With composed names use ALWAYS CamelCase and Decide on a strategy for Naming Gender and Number variations of the named entities.

Should be:
with proper names ALWAYS Capital Camel Case:

-- WinstonChurchill -- TomBrady -- MotherTheresa -- PopeFrancis -- SigourneyWeaver -- FederativeRepublicOfBrazil -- OlympicGames -- BlackPanthers -- MedievalHistory -- PythonFunctions
Use the 'minus' sign ( - ) to separate Acronyms inside expressions:

-- CSS-classes -- NATO-treaty -- inside-FBI-trading -- expanded-HTML
With composed common names and expressions ALWAYS small first-letter Camel Case:

-- zebra

but

-- maleZebra -- eastAfricanZebra

(Note: biological species should be written in singular form):

-- swordFish -- blueWhale -- snowTiger
But other categories should have Tags in the plural form

-- hardDisks -- penDrives -- motorcycleRaces -- weekEnds -- weekEndsAndHolidays
Also Expressions

-- whiteChristmas -- allRoadsLeadToRome -- winnerTakesAll

I hope that helps you understand we live in a profoundly Tagged Informational World today from which we cannot escape BUT that we can Tame...
