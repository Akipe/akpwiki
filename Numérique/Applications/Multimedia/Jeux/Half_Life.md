    One person creates a game as the host via the "Create Game" option in the main menu.
    The host takes note of their steam ID (e.g. STEAM_0:1:12345678) then shares it with their friends. -- If that's you use https://steamid.io/ to help you find it if you can't see it printed in your game's console.
    Their friends join the host's game by inserting the following into their console:
    connect STEAM_0:1:12345678
    Obviously replace STEAM_0:1:12345678 for the host's real steam ID. No quotes should be typed around it.
    Profit.
