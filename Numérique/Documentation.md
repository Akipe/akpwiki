# Documentation

Principes pour réaliser une bonne documentation.

## Grand Unified Theory of Documentation

This documentation follows the "Grand Unified Theory of Documentation". Therefore it consists of

- learning-oriented tutorials,
- problem-oriented how-to guides,
- understanding-oriented explanations and
- information-oriented references.

### Learning-Oriented Docs

> [Tutorials](https://documentation.divio.com/tutorials/) are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.

Example :  
Feel free to contribute or to extend this list:

- Installation
- Usage of queries
- Add an use properties

### Problem-Oriented Docs

> [How-to guides](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/) take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.

This might be the right place to explain workflows.

Feel free to contribute or to extend this list:

- Page alias
- Create a slide show
- Getting things done
- Content page

### Understanding-Oriented Docs

> [Explanation](https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/#), or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic. They broaden the documentation’s coverage of a topic.

Feel free to contribute or to extend this list:

- Explain the usage of properties
- Explain the different kinds of installations (app, online, self-hosted, ...)
- Backlinks

### Information-Oriented Docs

> [Reference guides](https://documentation.divio.com/reference/#) are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.

Feel free to contribute or to extend this list:

- List of frequently used queries (?)
- References for plugin implementation
