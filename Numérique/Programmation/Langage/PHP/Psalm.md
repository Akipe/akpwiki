# Psalm

Psalm helps people maintain a wide variety of codebases â€“ large and small, ancient and modern. On its strictest setting it can help you prevent almost all type-related runtime errors, and enables you to take advantage of safe coding patterns popular in other languages.

Psalm also fixes bugs automatically, allowing you to improve your code without breaking a sweat.
