# Snuffleupagus

Snuffleupagus is a PHP 7+ and 8+ module designed to drastically raise the cost of attacks against websites, by killing entire bug classes. It also provides a powerful virtual-patching system, allowing administrator to fix specific vulnerabilities and audit suspicious behaviours without having to touch the PHP code.
