## Livres

- Robert Martin’s “Clean Code”
- the Gang of Four’s “Design Patterns”
- A Philosophy of Software Design, looks like the closest thing to Clean-Code-but-actually-good that I’ve seen so far.
- The Practice of Programming
- Programming Pearls
- Software specifications and requirements by Jackson
- Plauger’s “Programming on Purpose I”
- Invariants: A generative approach to programming
- From mathematics to Generic Programming
- Writing Solid Code, definitely seems like the closest fit to “Clean Code” in terms of target audience, while actually being a good book.
- The Pragmatic Programmer is very good as it discusses not only code but all other activities involving programming: debugging, planning, testing, etc.
- Algorithms To Live by
- Cracking the Code Interview
- Effective Java
- David Agan’s book on Debugging
- Soul Of A New Machine, While it is not directly about design patterns or anything, it proves the age-old lesson that software is as much of a human problem as a computational one. Its age and staying power shows that while alot has changed in the software industry many of the fundamental problems we face (project management, customer alignment) are some of the biggest. It’s one of those books where you can re-read it at any stage in your career and glean new lessons.
- Modern Operating Systems, <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Operating_Systems>
- The New Turing Omnibus,  is a really cool introduction to computer science (less so programming)
- Code by Charles Petzoid, <https://codehiddenlanguage.com/>, is an excellent introduction to “computing” as a whole, focused on “how to encode real world information into signals that can be interpreted by another human which in turn can be interpreted by a computer”. I don’t think I would have understood it all in my early teens, but it would have given me a much more solid baseline for handling everything that came after.
- Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom, is a rock solid dive into “actually building something useful” that touches on all aspects of development in a conversational tone that I would have delighted in. Too many similar books are dry and boring, and having someone make jokes in the text would have helped me stay focused and follow through.
- Data-oriented design: software engineering for limited resources and short schedules, <https://www.amazon.com/dp/1916478700>
- The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Implementation-Operating-Addison-Wesley-Systems/dp/0201549794>
- The Missing README
- Guide to Competitive Programming <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-39357-1>
- To a person I do not know much about, I might gift Mazes for programmers <http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com/>
- Coders at work
- Concepts of programming languages, by Robert W. Sebesta
- Programming As If People Mattered
- Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About It? <https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html>
- Interactive Linear Algebra <https://services.math.duke.edu/~jdr/ila/>
